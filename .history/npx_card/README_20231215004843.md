# NPX CARD
This my NPX card unique style to connect with me directly via console or terminal

üëá just hit 
```bash
npx anmol
```
And get to know me in unique style.

### I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this iteration of npx card, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to put a **star** ‚≠ê on this project and not claim this effort as your own ‚ô•.
